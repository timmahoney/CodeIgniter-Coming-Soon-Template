Quick Coming Soon controller and view for CodeIgniter

The image links to Imgur, and the CSS is inline so no extra files beyond the controller and the view is needed.

Put the files in the correct folders, and update your routes.php file

If you're working with a new installation of CodeIgniter, open routes.php and replace: 

$route['default_controller'] = "welcome";

with:

$route['default_controller'] = "coming_soon";
